            Well, the first machine I got my hands on creates this water through a process called electrolysis. It worked very well, but there were two problems:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>It had poor filtering capabilities, so I was still drinking water that didn't taste very good.</li>
            <li>It costs almost $4,000!</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            So I began to research — and it was a grueling process. I felt like I was going down a rabbit hole.
          </p>

          <h3>But finally I made another discovery:</h3>

          <p>
            In the last couple years, this technology has made another leap forward. There is now a device that produces this fountain of youth naturally (no electrolysis involved) and has components with top-notch filtering capabilities to improve the taste of the water. So it both filters and ionizes water (which creates free hydrogen) right out of your sink.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, this new device literally replicates the way water is supposed to be in nature when you drink it fresh from a pristine mountain stream.
          </p>

          <h3>More good news:</h3>

          <p>
            I struck a deal with Laissez Faire to make this machine available to readers like yourself. Not only that, but because of a special arrangement with the supplier (which bypasses the usual route of a retail store) you can get this device at an absolute bargain.
          </p>

          <p>
            So don’t worry, your investment will just be a fraction of $4,000. I’ll explain the details in a moment.
          </p>

          <h2>FIRST, HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:</h2>

          <img src="http://d2fdrq23ypws1n.cloudfront.net/reports/LFW/Turapur_0615/Turapur_iHTML/images/InsideFilter.jpg" alt="Inside Filter" />

          <p>
            This small device is made for your normal, average kitchen. All you have to do is place it on your counter and hook the nozzle up to your sink. When you turn on your faucet, regular tap water flows into the device, where the filtering and ionization takes place. Then the special water comes out the top of this device, at which point you can use it for drinking and cooking. And any time you want to just use your sink regularly, you turn a special knob.
          </p>

          <p>
            It doesn’t get any simpler than that. Armed with this machine, and you’ll be able to transform any average tap water into the fountain of youth whenever you like.
