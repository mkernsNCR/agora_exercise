          Well, the first machine I got my hands on creates this water through a process called electrolysis. It worked very well, but there were two problems:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>It had poor filtering capabilities, so I was still drinking water that didn't taste very good.</li>
          <li>It costs almost $4,000!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          So I began to research — and it was a grueling process. I felt like I was going down a rabbit hole.
        </p>

        <h3>But finally I made another discovery:</h3>

        <p>
          In the last couple years, this technology has made another leap forward. There is now a device that produces this fountain of youth naturally (no electrolysis involved) and has components with top-notch filtering capabilities to improve the taste of the water. So it both filters and ionizes water (which creates free hydrogen) right out of your sink.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, this new device literally replicates the way water is supposed to be in nature when you drink it fresh from a pristine mountain stream.
        </p>

        <h3>More good news:</h3>

        <p>
          I struck a deal with Laissez Faire to make this machine available to readers like yourself. Not only that, but because of a special arrangement with the supplier (which bypasses the usual route of a retail store) you can get this device at an absolute bargain.
        </p>

        <p>
          So don’t worry, your investment will just be a fraction of $4,000. I’ll explain the details in a moment.
        </p>

        <h2>FIRST, HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:</h2>

        <img src="http://d2fdrq23ypws1n.cloudfront.net/reports/LFW/Turapur_0615/Turapur_iHTML/images/InsideFilter.jpg" alt="Inside Filter" />

        <p>
          This small device is made for your normal, average kitchen. All you have to do is place it on your counter and hook the nozzle up to your sink. When you turn on your faucet, regular tap water flows into the device, where the filtering and ionization takes place. Then the special water comes out the top of this device, at which point you can use it for drinking and cooking. And any time you want to just use your sink regularly, you turn a special knob.
        </p>

        <p>
          It doesn’t get any simpler than that. Armed with this machine, and you’ll be able to transform any average tap water into the fountain of youth whenever you like.

        <h2>THERE ARE THREE STAGES:</h2>

          <h2>STAGE 1:</h2>

          <p>
            WATER FROM YOUR FAUCET PASSES THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE FILTER.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, the three special filtering components strip out bad tastes and odors.
          </p>

          <p>
            The initial layer of filtration is a full inch of special KDF Process Media, which is backed by 15 patents and an NSF International certification.
          </p>

          <h2>STAGE 2:</h2>

          <p>
            WATER CONTINUES UP THE FILTER THROUGH THE ACTIVATED CARBON.
          </p>

          <p>
            The activated carbon portion of the filtration process uses Nuchar® AquaGuard® 325 — a high-activity, abrasion-resistant, small-mesh granular activated carbon.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is the stage that rids your water of bad tastes and odors.

          <h2>STAGE 3:</h2>

          <p>
            WATER SPILLS OUT THE TOP, LIKE A FOUNTAIN, EXITING THROUGH THE SPOUT.
          </p>

          <p>
            The magnesium and tourmaline spheres are used to free up hydrogen so it becomes a powerful antioxidant.

        <p>
          Due to its high degree of microporosity, just 4 tiny grams of activated carbon has a surface area in excess of 5000 m2, which is roughly…

        <h2>THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD!</h2>

        <p>
          Unlike regular carbon filters, the Nuchar® AquaGuard® 325 is derived from natural wood. As a result, it delivers higher surface area and pore volume per gram than carbon from other materials. In fact, wood carbon is 8–10x more absorbent than activated carbon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then in the third stage, certain minerals enrich the water and hydrogen is freed for your body to use.

        <p>
          First, the magnesium frees up some of the hydrogen. Remember the equation from before?

      <div class="col-md-12">

      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">

        <p>
          On the left side of the equation is magnesium and regular water. When they’re combined in a certain way, the magnesium atoms will attract some of the oxygen atoms, and they will pair together. Because of this, the hydrogen atoms will split from the oxygen.
        </p>

        <p>
          This allows them to act as bodyguards, throwing themselves into the line of fire and stopping the oxidative and aging process in trillion of your cells.
        </p>

        <p>
          And finally, the water goes through an additional stage to activate higher levels of free hydrogen, based on a study published in the Journal of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s composed of a combination of infrared ceramics and a certain kind of gemstone.

        <h2>…TRANSFORMING THE WATER INTO THE HYDROGEN-RICH, ANTIOXIDANT FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH!</h2>

        <p>
          Which is why Laissez Faire has named this remarkable machine the Turapür. It stands for the pure-tasting water it produces, and the tourmaline stones it uses to transform that water into your own powerful anti-aging elixir on tap.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you drink it, your body breaks down the hydrogen (using enzymes called hydrogenases) into single hydrogen ions, which seek out free radicals in your body’s 37.2 trillion cells.
